  "long_description": "Owned and operated by the Kootznoowoo people, the Kootznoowoo Project offers significant community and wildlife co-benefits. The surrounding region was previously heavily harvested for exports to overseas markets, but this project creates long term protection and management by native communities who have lived there for hundreds of years. The project area is used for community recreation and sustenance hunting. The project's substantial old-growth forest – 43% of the project area – provides essential habitat to Sitka black-tailed deer, black bears, mountain goats, moose, beavers, weasels, land otters, red foxes, and several species of salmon. The protected forest also has wide flora diversity - boasting a number of berry species like red elderberry, salmonberry, thimbleberry, blueberry, and huckleberry.",

  "long_description": "Distinctively, the Los Bancos project is directly owned and managed by members of the Los Bancos ejido. In Mexico, ejidos are areas of communal land use where the land is tended by its traditional inhabitants. The 44 ejidatarios who call Los Bancos home see carbon finance as a valuable way to balance their economic needs with their dedication to the land and have come together to commit over 80% of the ejido to the project. All ejidatarios participated in a series of community meetings and trainings prior to providing consent for entrusting their land to the project. As the land is communally owned, carbon revenue benefits are distributed amongst the community members. The project also employs several ejido members who provide administrative and forest management support to ensure the project’s ongoing success.",
